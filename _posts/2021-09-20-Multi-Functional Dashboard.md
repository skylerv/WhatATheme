This multi-functional home/office dashboard application mimics the capabilities of a typical Google Hub. This small project allowed me to showcase my skills in QT Creator and utilization of web APIs. This version consists of a digital clock, which pulls the current time of day and zone from the user's system settings and also displays a welcome message (e.g: "Good Morning", "Good Evening", etc..) based off the time of day. Current weather information is displayed on the dashboard, which is based off of the user's current/desired location. A map is given to the user as well, which leverages the Google Maps API and displays current traffic information. An input box is provided to the user, which allows the user to pick a desired zip code/city and display the current weather and traffic information to the dashboard. Finally, the dashboard is equipped with a small digital photo frame, which rotates through several photos to fit the dashboard's overall color scheme. You can find more screenshots and a small demo of the application below!
